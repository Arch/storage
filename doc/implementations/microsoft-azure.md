# Microsoft Azure

Microsoft Azure implementations reside in a separate package hosted on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Storage.Net.Microsoft.Azure/). Follow the link for installation instructions. The package implements all three aspects of storage - blobs, tables and queues.

## Blobs

Blobs are interfacing with the official [Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/storage/blobs/) and implement a good subset of functionality from the rich Blob Storage ecosystem in Azure.

This document assumes you are already familiar [how blobs are implemented in Storage.Net](../blob-storage/index.md)
